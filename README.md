Bang is a collection of custom nodes for the [Dynamo](http://www.dynamobim.org) visual programming environment. This package aims to add warning parsing functionality to Dynamo utilizing the Warnings API introduced in Revit 2018. 

If you appreciate the work put into this free package, please vote in support of it on Dynamo's package manager.

## Current Version
Bang is currently built against the latest Dynamo stable build. At this time that is 2.0.2.

## Updates
Since there is not currently an update notification process on Dynamo's package manager, I post notifications for updates on twitter.
